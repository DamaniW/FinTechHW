## Overview and Origin

* **Name of company:** Wealthfront Inc.

* **When was the company incorporated?** Wealthfront Inc. was founded in 2008 in Palo Alto, California as kaChing. The name change came in 2010, when kaChing raised $100 million in assets under Management and relaunched as Wealthfront. 

* **Who are the founders of the company?** The company was founded by Dan Carroll and Andy Rachleff, co-founder of Benchmark, a venture capital firm.

* **How did the idea for the company come about?** CEO Andy Rachleff, who at the time was teaching technology entrepreneurship courses at Stanford Graduate School of Business, had a a goal in mind. It was to leverage Internet technologies to provide high-quality investment funds to mainstream investors. Along with Dan Carroll, who's parents had bene hit hard by the financial crisis of 2008, was horrified at what the financial planner wronte in the statement. People like his parents didn’t get the attention they deserved, that they paid for. The two realized they not only shared a mission, to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice, they agreed that software could unlock great investing for everyone. 

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?** For the compnay to get on it's feet, kaChing received a $3 million seed round from Andreessen Horowitz in December 2008. Exactly a year later, DAG Ventures invested another $7.5 million into the company. Given that the company was managing user’s savings, it thus needed a more adultery image to increase trust. Thus, giving the birth of Wealthfront. In April 2014, Wealthfront raised $35 million in a funding round led by Index Ventures, Ribbit Capital and Benchmark Capital. By the time of the rebrand, Wealthfront had raised more than $100 million in assets under management (AUM).

## Business Activities

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?** As stated previously, the goal was to be able to leverage Internet technologies to provide high-quality investment funds to mainstream investors. Additionally, the company wanted to bring more transparency in the mutual fund industry, due to the nature of the industry being secretive about their returns and only reporting positions held at the end of each quarter. The best performing investors were labeled as "Geniuses" and registered users were able to mimic the trades automatically through the app. This way, investors with low to average knowledge of investing can see exactly where their money was being invested. 

* **Who is the company's intended customer?**  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?** In an interview in 2012, with CEO Andy Rachleff, he stated "Our clients are typically 25 to 35-year-olds who work in (Silicon) Valley at tech companies. Many either will or have gone through a recent IPO or acquisition"(investorplace.com). The overall target audience are  tech-saavy millenial investors. “The fact is that Millennials already control $2 trillion. That will grow to $7 trillion by 2018,”(www.entrepreneur.com) said Nash, CEO of Wealthfront at the time, in an interview. However, as of 2019, Wealthfront has signed up 270,000 accounts, with roughly $13 billion in assets under management. Roughly 90 percent of these customers are under the age of 45(cnbc.com). Wealthfront aims to be completely automated and provides its users with Path, the free financial planning tool that integrates your account data and uses third-party data to better project your financial situation.

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** Wealthfront are most known for their superior robo-advisor. Robo-advisors are a class of financial adviser that provide financial advice or investment management online with moderate to minimal human intervention, or in Wealthfront's case, no human intervention at all. They provide digital financial advice based on mathematical rules or algorithms. These algorithms are designed by financial advisors, investment managers and data scientists, and coded in software by programmers. These algorithms are executed by software and do not require a human advisor to impart financial advice to a client. The software utilizes its algorithms to automatically allocate, manage and optimize clients' assets for either short-run or long-run investment. 

  * The name for their automated robo-advisor is Path. The full overview of Path can be found here: https://blog.wealthfront.com/introducing-path/, but listed below are the key aspects of Path:
   * Fully automated financial planning and advising.
   * Continuous tracking of transactions to give advice based on personal spending
   * Access to retirement and investment accounts that are automatically distrubuted based on income of any size or as much customization based on user investing account size.

* Additionally, Wealthfront has introduced the new Cash Account. The goal for this account is to act as a hybrid of a checking and savings account. The most notable features of this account are:
   * A 0.10% APY interest rate. Higher than the national avaerage of .06%.
   * Wealthfront’s “Autopilot” tool allows its users to set a maximum account balance on their Wealthfront Cash Account or other checking account and automatically move additional cash into a Wealthfront Taxable Investment Account, Traditional IRA, Roth IRA or 529 College Savings Account(nerdwallet.com).
   * Wealthfront’s “Self-Driving Money” tool allows customers to organize their savings goals into different buckets, as well as instantly invest their savings instead of waiting for their money to transfer to their investment account(nerdwallet.com).

## Landscape

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?** Wealthfront Inc. operates in the robo-advising and wealth/investing managemnt domains as a top competitor. Recently, the company has taken a step into the personal finance/online banking with their new Cash Account. 

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?** When it comes to robo-advising, the main goal is to provide financial planning and advising with little to no human interaction as possible. As previously mentioned Wealthfront is a top competetitor in this sector with is "Path" robo-advisor. In the investment management domain, the introduction of cryptocurrency and exchange traded funds (ETFs), provides access to a much larger market of investors, which Wealthfront has incorporated in their "Autopilot" tool and investment planning.

* **What are the other major companies in this domain?** Wealthfront's number one competitor is Betterment, due to the nature of the companies being so similar. However, Wealthfront is better for investors with a little more knowledge of investing for the reason that person-to-person guidance is not used as much. Whereas Betterment has financial planners that can be accessed for a fee of up to $299. Other competitors in this domain are Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Sigfig, Altruist, Personal Capital and more.

## Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?** Wealthfront is one of the largest and fastest growing FinTech startups due to its unique feature of taking the human out of financial planning. The company has stayed true to its word of providing high quality financial/investment planning, fully automated and based on the user's personal use of their finances. When it comes to robo-advising, Wealthfront is on top. 

* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success?** For robo-advising companies the success comes from how satisfied their users are, based on portfolio performace and features that make it easy to tell what is happening with their money. Some of these metrics are:
   * Features and Accessibility
     * A rare 529 college savings account that very few companies offer. Weatherfront does. 
   * Fees (lower the better)
   * Security/Insurance on money
   * Customer Service
   * Diversity of Portfolios

* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?** For a majority of it's lifespan, Wealthfront was a head of the game being number one for robo-adviding. However since 2019, Betterment has taken the throne with a higher AUM raised and lower minimums on accounts for access to a larger audience. As of March 2021 for total assets under management, the ranks are as follows:
  1. Vanguard ($212 billion AUM)
  2. Charles Schwab ($57.9 billion AUM)
  3. Betterment ($18.1 billion AUM)
  4. Personal Capital ($16.5 million AUM)
  5. Weatherfront ($15.85 nillion AUM)


## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?** If Wealthfront wants a larger stake with the millennial and up coming Gen Y market, it should look into lowering it's account minimum. As it currently stands, the minimum for an account is $500. Lowering this fee to $150/$100 it would open access to communites that usually don't have the opportunity to invest at an early age. For a more technical service, the company can try a "Auto Day Trader" tool. This would cater towards more riskier investors who want to make lots of returns with smaller gains. With this automated tool, the user would be able to set a maximum risk from their investment account and the number of trades they want to make.  

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?** With this tool, Wealthfront would be able to add another piece to its arsenal of superior automated investing. Additionally, it would diversify the type of accounts its users can utilize and would cover all the types of investment accounts; retirement, long-term, future investments and short-term. This could attract investors with larger access to capital who want to see their money active at all times. 

* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?** The core of this tool would be an algo-trading AI. It would need to be able to process daily trading activity over years at a time, while taking into account of the user's investment capabilities. Since this would be a massive amount of data, possibly starting with only cryptocurrencies, since they are newer with less years of data and more volatile.
